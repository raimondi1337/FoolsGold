//Jade is a whitespace sensitive HTML template language
//ELEMENTS###############################
//Elements on the same level are in the same hierarchy in HTML
//Elements indented further than the one above them are children of the one above
//In the example above, the head tag is indented one level in from the html
//This means that the head tag is contained by the HTML. 
//The meta tag is then indented below the head that. That means the meta tag is a 
//child tag of the head tag
//ATTRIBUTES#############################
//Attributes in Jade are passed into like elements like function parameters (comma separated)
//Otherwise attributes look the same as they do in HTML
//IDS####################################
//In Jade Ids are tacked onto the element with the CSS/JS syntax. You just add them at the end
//An h3 tag with the ID "main" would be h3#main
//CLASSES################################
//Classes in Jade are tacked onto the element with the CSS/JS syntax. You just add them at the end
//An h3 tag with the class "underlined" would be h3.underlined
//An h3 tag with both the classes "underlined" and "hidden" would be h3.underlined.hidden 
//With the ID "main" this would look like h3#main.underlined.hidden
